    "When it comes to lending, there have always been disparities between different groups of people in terms of acceptance and accessibility. There have been numerous ways in which discrimination has been employed throughout the years, with lending being one of the largest areas. We wanted to examine the disparities that exist between groups based on race, gender, and sexual orientation among others. The reason we came to these disparities was based on reading previous works done through research institutions such as Vanderbilt University (https://business.vanderbilt.edu/news/2020/07/20/racial-disparities-in-lending-markets/), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (https://www.pnas.org/content/116/19/9293), and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (https://ncrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ncrc%20nosheild%20june%2009.pdf). We wanted to see the specificities of these disparities in terms of how they are carried out in the real world, whether certain other inequities have a domino effect towards lending data, and what potential solutions there may be to this disparity. To look into this, we took in data from the HMDA, short for the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which will show data on loan applications for houses. We will be able to see many factors such as race, gender of applicant and co-applicant, income bracket, reason for loan denial, and more. Throughout the research project, we will dive into different areas of discrimination or bias seen in lending data provided by the HMDA in 2017, finding the reasons behind them, and looking into potential areas that will need to be addressed by lenders in the future for a more equitbale experience for everybody."

    "The data provided by HMDA dataset provides a lot of insight into the inequities that are present in loans. The data in question is the most recently available set to us, which is 2017. In the preliminary exploratory data analysis, we looked into three factors: application status based on race, application status based on the sex of the applicant and co-applicant, and the reasons for denial based on race. What we found in this step was interesting. In terms of application status based on race, we noticed significant discrepancies for loan approvals by race, with White and Asian applicants seeing approval ratings around 58%, Hawaiian Native and Pacfic Islander applicants around 51%, and Native American and Black applicants around 44-45%. This shows a significant gap in loan approval ratings between racial groups and this is something we look to further examine in our paper. For the sex of applicant and co-applicant, we wanted to see if there were any significant discrepancies. While we cannot assume that an applicant and a co-applicant would be in a relationship, we thought it would be important to see the approval and rejection ratings for these combinations. What we noted was that generally, applications where a male is the applicant and a female is a co-applicant have the highest approval rating at around 61%, with female applicant and male co-applicant following at 58.8%, male applicant and co-applicant at 58%, and female appplicant and co-applicant at 55.1%. We noticed somewhat significant differences between these rates and we look to further explore this area. Finally, we looked at reasons for rejection by race. While the rankings of denial reasons were roughly similar amongst all groups, we noticed some differences in the percentages that these reasons made up for each group. We believe this will be an interesting area to further examine in the final paper. Based on our EDA, we found numerous statistical differences in the loan data that would potentially point to inequities in this system of America. As a result, this dataset is a strong source to examine the problem at hand and examine the specificities of this inequity in our society."
